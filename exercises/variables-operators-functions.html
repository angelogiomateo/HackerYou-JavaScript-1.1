		var daysYear = 365;
		var hoursDay = 24;
		var minsHour = 60;
		var secsMin = 60;	

		//EXERCISE 1
		//1. Ask the user for their age.
		//2. Store the answer and convert their age into seconds.
		//3. Log into the console their age in seconds.
		//4. Try concatenating the answer into a sentence: Your age in seconds is --.

			var age = prompt("How old are you?");
			var ageSecs = age * daysYear * hoursDay * minsHour * secsMin;
			console.log(ageSecs);
			console.log(`Your age in seconds is ${ageSecs}.`);

		//EXERCISE 2
		//1. Create 3 variables that asks the user for three numbers.
		//2. Use a function to find the maximum of the three.
		//3. Log the answer into the console using the sentence: The maximum number is --.

			var num1 = prompt("Choose a number.");
			var num2 = prompt("Choose another number.");
			var num3 = prompt("Choose another number.");
			var maxNum = Math.max(num1, num2, num3);

		// EXERCISE 3
		// Write some code that finds the youngest person out of three ages.
		// Log into the console the sentence: The youngest person is -- years old.

			var siblingAge1 = prompt("What is your sibling's age?");
			var siblingAge2 = prompt("What is your other sibling's age?");
			var minAge = Math.min(age, siblingAge1, siblingAge2);
			console.log(`The youngest person is ${minAge}.`);

		// EXERCISE 4
		// Write some code that returns a random number between 1 and 100.
		// Log into the console the sentence: Your random number is --.
		// Bonus points for returning a whole number (no decimals).
    // Hint: Look into Math.random and Math.round

    		var random = Math.random() * (100 - 1) + 1;
    		console.log(Math.round(random));



		// EXERCISE 5
		// Write some code that adds sales tax to a price.
		// Log into the console the sentence: "The total price with tax is $--."
		// Bonus points if you can get it to show 2 decimals. (Google it!)

			var price = prompt("What is the price?");

			console.log(`The total price with tax is \$${Math.round(plusTax, -2)}.`);
			console.log(`The total price with tax is \$${plusTax.toFixed(2)}.`);
